> Anthropocentric thought is a mental disease, a voluntary one once observed. No matter human technological advancements, we are the invasive species. The things humans do to existence for entertainment, desire, sensation, profit, etc are abhorrent.

> Corporations exploit existence and co-opt social movements in order to market them. Mindless consumers think that by donating some of their federal debt credits(dollars) to some organization(charity, gofundme, etc) that their "part" in society is accomplished, even though it is their daily behaviors that cause the need for it in the first place.

> This documentation of my species observations aims to help people see that we are not the center of existence, biodiversity is necessary, and the corporate construct is destroying it. The species I upload have to meet certain criteria. There are millions of species around, I am not going to upload the planet though I would if I could. A species being repulsive looking or smelling is not criteria for me to omit it and not excuse for you to harm it.

> I have video of a human running over turtles(not swerving, but going off road to hit nesting mothers) https://www.tiktok.com/@sixie6e/video/7410863916957338922 and the Maine game warden doing nothing. Police in Maine beat porcupines out of existence for snapchat https://www.idausa.org/campaign/justice-for-animals/latest-news/porcupine-killing/, so...I shouldn't be surprised. This is why police have to do photoshoots with puppies and children in order to gain public favor. I live each day causing the LEAST amount of suffering for other beings possible which refutes the "gardening kills organisms" line slaughterhouse mouths love to copy and paste. Religious/nationalist doctrines have them believing it is their "right" to harm other beings to sustain self. Humans love picking and choosing when to fancy themselves evolved.
