							<h3>Urceolus cyclostomus</h3>
							<p>Urceolus cyclostomus is a species of flagellate, a single-celled protist that exhibits an emergent flagellum for movement. Members of the genus Urceolus are distinguished by the presence of a 'neck' at the anterior end of their oval-shaped cell, followed by a wide aperture or 'mouth' into a deep canal where the feeding groove and the flagellum originate. In addition, like other euglenids, the cell surface or pellicle is spiral-striped. In particular, U. cyclostomus is distinguished from other species of the genus by its more or less rigid and regular body shape, a less developed 'ingestive organelle' or feeding apparatus, and a more conspicuous 'hatching' (i.e. more pronounced stripes) of the pellicle. The posterior end of the cell is narrow, as is common in other euglenids. The cells are ovate, measuring 14–30 μm long and 4–18 μm wide. The cells move by crawling through the substrate, with the posterior end raised. The flagellum is around 1.5 times longer than the cell itself, 40–50 μm. </p>

							<h3>Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa</h3>
							<p>Ceratiomyxa is a genus of plasmodial slime mould within the Eumycetozoa, first described by Pier Antonio Micheli. They are widely distributed and commonly found on decaying wood. The plasmodium often appears as white frost-like growth or thin watery layers on wood. Pillar or wall-like sporangia bud from the plasmodium and develop spores that undergo multiple divisions before they release flagellated zoospores. The zoospores will then pair off, undergo plasmogamy, and form zygotes that will later form new plasmodia. The genus currently contains 4 species. The most notable member is Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa, a slime mould found in most parts of the world. Other known species of Ceratiomyxa are mostly found in the tropics. </p>

							<h3>Metatrichia vesparium</h3>
							<p>The fruiting body is a stalked sporangium that can be 1–1.5 mm tall. The sporotheca is obovate, usually in clusters, and is wine-red to dark maroon or nearly black. The stalk is solid and brick red. The capillitium is made up of long, free elaters that are bright red to deep crimson. The spores are brownish red in mass and reddish orange by transmitted light.Metatrichia vesparium is commonly found on decaying wood or bark, especially from broadleaf trees. It can also be found on dead leaves, living tree bark, and herbivore dung. Metatrichia vesparium is common and widespread in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, but less common in tropical regions and the Southern Hemisphere. </p>

							<h3>Order Arcellinida</h3>
							<p>Arcellinid testate amoebae or Arcellinida, Arcellacean or lobose testate amoebae are single-celled protists partially enclosed in a simple test (shell). Arcellinid testate amoebae are commonly found in soils, leaf litter, peat bogs and near/in fresh water. They use their pseudopodia, a temporary cell extension, for moving and taking in food. Like most amoebae, they are generally believed to reproduce asexually via binary fission. However a recent review suggests that sexual recombination may be the rule rather than the exception in amoeboid protists in general, including the Arcellinid testate amoebae.</p>

							<h3>Stemonitis axifera</h3>
							<p>The erect, stalked cylindrical sporangia are arranged into bundles or clusters that are 7–15 mm (0.3–0.6 in) tall. Each sporangium is supported by a thin, shining, black stalk that is 3–7 mm (0.1–0.3 in) long. The bright rusty brown color of mature sporangia lightens to a pale brown after the spores have been dispersed. Spores measure 5 by 7 μm and have a smooth to minutely punctate surface texture.Stemonitis axifera requires about 20 hours to finish making its fruit bodies. Of this, eight hours are needed for induction of the sporangia and the development of the stalk and the columella, six hours more for the sporocarps to produce pigment and mature, and an additional six until the spores are discharged.</p>
