							<h3>Urceolus cyclostomus</h3>
							<p>Urceolus cyclostomus is a species of flagellate, a single-celled protist that exhibits an emergent flagellum for movement. Members of the genus Urceolus are distinguished by the presence of a 'neck' at the anterior end of their oval-shaped cell, followed by a wide aperture or 'mouth' into a deep canal where the feeding groove and the flagellum originate. In addition, like other euglenids, the cell surface or pellicle is spiral-striped. In particular, U. cyclostomus is distinguished from other species of the genus by its more or less rigid and regular body shape, a less developed 'ingestive organelle' or feeding apparatus, and a more conspicuous 'hatching' (i.e. more pronounced stripes) of the pellicle. The posterior end of the cell is narrow, as is common in other euglenids. The cells are ovate, measuring 14–30 μm long and 4–18 μm wide. The cells move by crawling through the substrate, with the posterior end raised. The flagellum is around 1.5 times longer than the cell itself, 40–50 μm. </p>

							<h3>Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa</h3>
							<p>Ceratiomyxa is a genus of plasmodial slime mould within the Eumycetozoa, first described by Pier Antonio Micheli. They are widely distributed and commonly found on decaying wood. The plasmodium often appears as white frost-like growth or thin watery layers on wood. Pillar or wall-like sporangia bud from the plasmodium and develop spores that undergo multiple divisions before they release flagellated zoospores. The zoospores will then pair off, undergo plasmogamy, and form zygotes that will later form new plasmodia. The genus currently contains 4 species. The most notable member is Ceratiomyxa fruticulosa, a slime mould found in most parts of the world. Other known species of Ceratiomyxa are mostly found in the tropics. </p>

							<h3>Order Arcellinida</h3>
							<p>Arcellinid testate amoebae or Arcellinida, Arcellacean or lobose testate amoebae are single-celled protists partially enclosed in a simple test (shell). Arcellinid testate amoebae are commonly found in soils, leaf litter, peat bogs and near/in fresh water. They use their pseudopodia, a temporary cell extension, for moving and taking in food. Like most amoebae, they are generally believed to reproduce asexually via binary fission. However a recent review suggests that sexual recombination may be the rule rather than the exception in amoeboid protists in general, including the Arcellinid testate amoebae.</p>

							<h3>Stemonitis axifera</h3>
							<p>The erect, stalked cylindrical sporangia are arranged into bundles or clusters that are 7–15 mm (0.3–0.6 in) tall. Each sporangium is supported by a thin, shining, black stalk that is 3–7 mm (0.1–0.3 in) long. The bright rusty brown color of mature sporangia lightens to a pale brown after the spores have been dispersed. Spores measure 5 by 7 μm and have a smooth to minutely punctate surface texture.Stemonitis axifera requires about 20 hours to finish making its fruit bodies. Of this, eight hours are needed for induction of the sporangia and the development of the stalk and the columella, six hours more for the sporocarps to produce pigment and mature, and an additional six until the spores are discharged.</p>

							<h3>Phacus sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Phacus is a genus of unicellular excavates, of the phylum Euglenozoa (also known as Euglenophyta), characterized by its flat, leaf-shaped structure, and rigid cytoskeleton known as a pellicle. These eukaryotes are mostly green in colour, and have a single flagellum that extends the length of their body. They are morphologically very flat, rigid, leaf-shaped, and contain many small discoid chloroplasts. Phacus are commonly found in freshwater habitats around the globe and include several hundred species that continue to be discovered to this day. There are 564 species of Phacus in the database, but only 171 have been accepted taxonomically. The genus was established in 1841 and since then major discoveries have led it to become an extremely large group containing hundreds of species with varied physiological characteristics. Contemporary studies agree that Phacus is not monophyletic or holophyletic, but is actually polyphyletic. Unfortunately, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus are poorly understood. </p>

							<h3>Chaos carolinensis</h3>
							<p>Chaos is a genus of single-celled amoeboid organisms in the family Amoebidae. The largest and most-known species, the so-called "giant amoeba" (Chaos carolinensis), can reach lengths up to 5 mm, although most specimens fall between 1 and 3 mm. Members of this genus closely resemble those of the genus Amoeba and share the same general morphology, producing numerous cylindrical pseudopods, each of which is rounded at the tip. However, while Amoeba have a single nucleus, Chaos can have as many as a thousand. Because of this attribute, C. carolinensis was once placed in the genus Pelomyxa alongside the giant multinucleate amoeba Pelomyxa palustris. Recently, molecular phylogenetic studies of this species have confirmed the view of some earlier researchers that it is more closely related to Amoeba than to Pelomyxa. The species is now placed in the independent genus Chaos, a sister group to Amoeba.</p>

							<h3>Physarum polycephalum</h3>
							<p>Physarum polycephalum, an acellular slime mold or myxomycete popularly known as "the blob", is a protist with diverse cellular forms and broad geographic distribution. The “acellular” moniker derives from the plasmodial stage of the life cycle: the plasmodium is a bright yellow macroscopic multinucleate coenocyte shaped in a network of interlaced tubes. This stage of the life cycle, along with its preference for damp shady habitats, likely contributed to the original mischaracterization of the organism as a fungus. P. polycephalum is used as a model organism for research into motility, cellular differentiation, chemotaxis, cellular compatibility, and the cell cycle. It is commonly cultivated. The two vegetative cell types, amoebae and plasmodia, differ markedly in morphology, physiology and behavior. Amoebae are microorganisms, typically haploid, that live primarily in the soil, where they phagocytose bacteria. In the laboratory, amoebae are grown on lawns of live or dead Escherichia coli on nutrient agar plates, where they can multiply indefinitely. Axenic culture of amoebae was achieved through selection of mutants capable of axenic growth. Under conditions of starvation or desiccation, the amoebae differentiate reversibly into dormant spores with cell walls. When immersed in water, amoebae differentiate reversibly into flagellated cells, which involves a major reorganization of the cytoskeleton. The plasmodium is typically diploid and propagates via growth and nuclear division without cytokinesis, resulting in the macroscopic multinucleate syncytium; in other words, a large single cell with multiple nuclei. While nutrients are available, the network-shaped plasmodium can grow to a foot or more in diameter. Like amoebae, the plasmodium can consume whole microbes, but also readily grows axenically in liquid cultures, nutrient agar plates and on nutrient-moistened surfaces. When nutrients are provided uniformly, the nuclei in the plasmodium divide synchronously, accounting for the interest in using P. polycephalum as a model organism to study the cell cycle, or more specifically the nuclear division cycle. When the plasmodium is starved, it has two alternative developmental pathways. In the dark, the plasmodium typically differentiates reversibly into a dormant “sclerotium” (the same term is used for dormant forms of fungal mycelia, but the myxomycete sclerotium is a very different structure). When exposed to light, the starving plasmodium differentiates irreversibly into sporangia that are distinguished from other Physarum species by their multiple heads (hence polycephalum). Meiosis occurs during spore development, resulting in haploid dormant spores. Upon exposure to moist nutrient conditions, the spores develop into amoebae, or, in aqueous suspension, into flagellates. The life cycle is completed when haploid amoebae of different mating types fuse to form a diploid zygote that then develops by growth and nuclear division in the absence of cytokinesis into the multinucleate plasmodium.</p>

							<h3>Arcyria denudata</h3>
							<p>Arcyria denudata, also known as the carnival candy slime mold or cotton candy slime mold, is a type of fungus that is characterized by its bright red or pink color and fluffy appearance. The fruiting bodies are egg-shaped or short cylindrical, and are usually 1–3 mm tall. The stalk is dark red-brown and about 1 mm tall. Arcyria denudata typically grows in large colonies on decaying wood or the bark of trees in forests. As the fruiting bodies mature, they open and expand to release spores, giving the slime mold a fluffy appearance. The micro-structure of Arcyria denudata resembles a tangled mass of vertebrate spines, and contains spores and amoeba. </p>

							<h3>Testate Amoeba</h3>
							<p>Testate amoebae (formerly thecamoebians, Testacea or Thecamoeba) are a polyphyletic group of unicellular amoeboid protists, which differ from naked amoebae in the presence of a test that partially encloses the cell, with an aperture from which the pseudopodia emerge, that provides the amoeba with shelter from predators and environmental conditions. The test of some species is produced entirely by the amoeba and may be organic, siliceous or calcareous depending on the species (autogenic tests), whereas in other cases the test is made up of particles of sediment collected by the amoeba which are then agglutinated together by secretions from within the cell (xenogenic tests). A few taxa (Hyalospheniidae) can build either type, depending on the circumstances and availability of foreign material. The assemblage referred to as "testate amoebae" is actually composed of several, unrelated groups of organisms. However, some features they all share that have been used to group them together include the presence of a test (regardless of its composition) and pseudopodia that do not anastomose. Testate amoebae can be found in most freshwater environments, including lakes, rivers, cenotes, as well as mires and soils. The strong and resistant nature of the tests allows them to be preserved long after the amoeba has died. These characteristics, along with the sensitivity that some species display to changes in environmental conditions (such as temperature, pH, and conductivity), has sparked their use as bioindicators and paleoclimate proxies in recent years.</p>
