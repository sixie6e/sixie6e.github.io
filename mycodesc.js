enada: Amanita bisporigera

cl: Amanita bisporigera is a deadly poisonous species of fungus in the family Amanitaceae. It is commonly known as the eastern destroying angel amanita, the eastern North American destroying angel or just as the destroying angel, although the fungus shares this latter name with three other lethal white Amanita species, A. ocreata, A. verna and A. virosa. The mushroom has a smooth white cap that can reach up to 10cm across and a stipe up to 14cm tall with a white skirt-like ring near the top. The bulbous stipe base is covered with a membranous sac-like volva. The white gills are free from attachment to the stalk and crowded closely together. As the species name suggests, A. bisporigera typically bears two spores on the basidia, although this characteristic is not immutable. A. bisporigera closely resembles a few other white amanitas, including the equally deadly A. virosa and A. verna.

It belongs in the family Mycenaceae, and the type species of the genus Panellus. A common and widely distributed species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America, where it grows in groups or dense overlapping clusters on the logs, stumps, and trunks of deciduous trees, especially beech, oak, and birch. During the development of the fruit bodies, the mushrooms start out as tiny white knobs, which, over a period of one to three months, develop into fan- or kidney-shaped caps that measure up to 3cm broad. The caps are orange-yellow to brownish, and attached to the decaying wood by short stubby stalks that are connected off-center or on the side of the caps.

It is found in Great Britain and Ireland, including the Outer Hebrides, mainland Europe, and occasionally in North America, and is commonly seen in sand dune systems, where it can be abundant in dune slacks as well as in grassland and lawns, as its vernacular name suggests. In the early stages of development its skin is scruffy whereas its bigger relatives have smooth skins; the meadow puffball is edible and has a stump-like stem (to differentiate it from the giant puffball). 

et: With the name Neolecta irregularis, usually adapted as the common name “irregular earth tongue”, this fungus can be identified in the woods of North America and Japan by its irregular and unbranched yellow fruiting bodies that appear sprouting from the ground near trees.

ttail: Trametes versicolor – also known as Coriolus versicolor and Polyporus versicolor – is a common polypore mushroom found throughout the world.
