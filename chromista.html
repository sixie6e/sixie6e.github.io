							<h3>Euplotes sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Euplotes cells are inflexible, dorsoventrally flattened, and roughly ovoid, with a very large oral region (peristome) bordered on the left by a long "adoral zone of membranelles" (AZM). Like other spirotrich ciliates, Euplotes move and feed with the help of compound ciliary organelles called "cirri," made up of thick tufts of cilia sparsely distributed on the cell. Strong cirri on the ventral surface of the cell enable Euplotes to walk or crawl on submerged detritus and vegetation. All species of Euplotes have a group of stiff bristles (caudal cirri), which protrude from the posterior of the cell. The number of caudal cirri varies, even within a species, but it is most common for Euplotes to have 4 or 5. The macronucleus is typically long and narrow, and approximately horseshoe-shaped, C-shaped, or resembling the number 3.</p>

							<h3>Stentor pyriformis</h3>
							<p>Stentor pyriformis represents a green, short, and fat Stentor, but it is a little-known species. We investigated 124 ponds and wetlands in Japan and confirmed the presence of S. pyriformis at 23 locations. All these ponds were noticeably oligotrophic. With the improvement of oligotrophic culture conditions, we succeeded in long-term cultivation of three strains of S. pyriformis. The cytoplasm of S. piriformis contains a large number of 1–3 μm refractive granules that turn brown by Lugol’s staining. The granules also show a typical Maltese-cross pattern by polarization microscopy, strongly suggesting that the granules are made of amylopectin-rich starch. By analyzing the algal rDNA, it was found that all S. pyriformis symbionts investigated in this study were Chlorella variabilis. This species is known as the symbiont of Paramecium bursaria and is physiologically specialized for endosymbiosis. Genetic discrepancies between C. variabilis of S. pyriformis and P. bursaria may indicate that algal sharing was an old incident. Having symbiotic algae and storing carbohydrate granules in the cytoplasm is considered a powerful strategy for this ciliate to withstand oligotrophic and cold winter environments in highland bogs.</p>

							<h3>Centroheliozoa</h3>
							<p>Individuals are unicellular and spherical, usually around 30–80 μm in diameter, and covered with long radial axopods, narrow cellular projections that capture food and allow mobile forms to move about. A few genera have no cell covering, but most have a gelatinous coat holding scales and spines, produced in special deposition vesicles. These may be organic or siliceous and come in various shapes and sizes. For instance, in Raphidiophrys the coat extends along the bases of the axopods, covering them with curved spicules that give them a pine-treeish look, and in Raphidiocystis there are both short cup-shaped spicules and long tubular spicules that are only a little shorter than the axopods. Some other common genera include Heterophrys, Actinocystis, and Oxnerella. The axopods of centrohelids are supported by microtubules in a triangular-hexagonal array, which arise from a tripartite granule called the centroplast at the center of the cell. Axopods with a similar array occur in gymnosphaerids, which have traditionally been considered centrohelids (though sometimes in a separate order from the others). This was questioned when it was found they have mitochondria with tubular cristae, as do other heliozoa, while in centrohelids the cristae are flat. Although this is no longer considered a very reliable character, on balance gymnosphaerids seem to be a separate group. </p>

							<p>Paramecium bursaria is a species of ciliate found in marine and brackish waters. It has a mutualistic endosymbiotic relationship with green algae called Zoochlorella. About 700 Chlorella cells live inside the protist's cytoplasm and provide it with food, while the Paramecium provides the algae with movement and protection. P. bursaria is 80-150 μm long, with a wide oral groove, two contractile vacuoles, and a single micronucleus as well as a single macronucleus. P. bursaria is the only species of Paramecium that forms symbiotic relationships with algae, and it is often used in biology classrooms both as an example of a protozoan and also as an example of symbiosis.</p>

							<h3>Navicula sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Navicula is a genus of boat-shaped diatom (single-celled photosynthetic organisms), comprising over 1,200 species, though many Navicula species likely do not belong in the genus strictly speaking. Navicula is Latin for "small ship", and also a term in English for a boat-shaped incense-holder. Navicula is a cosmopolitan genus and species are present in both freshwater and marine environments, typically attached to surfaces. Navicula species are pennate diatoms. Their valves are typically elliptical, though some species have more pinched ends than others. Navicula cells have two chloroplasts, one along each side of the valve along the girdle bands. Navicula diatoms are highly motile and move through a gliding movement This is done through excretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). One form of EPS surrounds the outside of the cell and another is excreted through a slit in the frustule called a raphe, allowing the cell to glide along a track. </p>

							<h3>Cymbella sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Valves are slightly to stongly asymmetrical to the apical axis, and symmetrical to the transapical axis. Species with slight asymmetry may be very close to naviculoid symmetry. The raphe is centrally or eccentrically positioned. Stigmata are absent, or if present, located on the ventral side of the central area. The distal raphe ends are straight or deflected dorsally. Cells grow in benthic habitats, often surrounded by mucilage or producing mucilaginous stalks. Apical pore fields may be absent, or present at both poles. Taxa with apical pore fields are likely to be found growing on stalks. The broad sense of Cymbella embraced here (Krammer, 1982; Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1986; Round et al., 1990) is probably not a natural group of taxa. As such, it contains a heterogeneous assemblage of taxa that are not referred to Encyonema or Reimeria. A natural group within Cymbella contains species with ventrally placed stigmata, dorsally deflected external distal raphe ends, and apical pore fields. Krammer's work has led to a broad understanding of the valve (Krammer, 1982), raphe (Krammer, 1979), and girdle components of cymbelloid frustule (Krammer, 1981). Krammer (1997a, b) has begun to revise the genus and identify clusters of morphologically similar species. Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1986) offer an excellent account of common members of the genus. Cymbella is a large genus and is often common in benthic habitats across North America. As a genus, it varies greatly in size and degree of asysmmetry, with some species with only slight asysmmetry to the apical axis. North American species have been considered by Hufford and Collins (1972a, b), Kingston (1978), and Selva (1981). Geitler (1927, 1956, 1967) and Geitler and Mack (1953) have documented sexual reproduction.</p>

							<h3>Nitzschia sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Nitzschia is a common pennate marine diatom. In the scientific literature, this genus, named after Christian Ludwig Nitzsch, is sometimes referred to incorrectly as Nitzchia, and it has many species described, which all have a similar morphology. In its current circumscription, Nitzschia is paraphyletic. Nitzschia is found mostly in colder waters, and is associated with both Arctic and Antarctic polar sea ice, where it is often found to be the dominant diatom. Nitzschia includes several species of diatoms known to produce the neurotoxin known as domoic acid, a toxin responsible for the human illness called amnesic shellfish poisoning. The species N. frigida is found to grow exponentially even at temperatures between −4 and −6 °C. Some Nitzschia species are also extremophiles by dint of tolerance to high salinity; for example, some halophilic species of Nitzschia are found in the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana.</p>

							<h3>Ophiocytiaum sp unknown</h3>
							<p>The alga lives individually or in tree-shaped bandages that are stuck with a stem or float in the plankton. The cells are cylindrical to long tube-shaped and then usually squeen-shaped. Its diameter is 3 to 30 Ã...m, its length can be over 1000 Ã...m. Young cells have an elongated oval shape and contain only one nucleus. Older cells are very long and have many cell nuclei as well as wall-mounted, green-coloured plastids. Reserve carbohydrates (chromosolaminaria) are deposited outside the plastids in the cytoplasm. There is often a sting on the cells. The cell wall consists of two large parts. One part is very long, the other is short and serves as a lid during reproduction. The asexual increase occurs through the formation of zoospores with much long scourges inside the long-stretched cells. Rarely does it come to the formation of aplanospores (unhaunted spores). After the opening of the lid, the zoospores of some species settle at the opening with a stem and thus form tree-shaped colonies. Sexual reproduction is not known. </p>

							<h3>Diatom reproduction</h3>
							<p>A single diatom cell can divide and form two new cells. Cells may divide as quickly as once a day up to once every several weeks. The silica cell wall is a sort of biological constraint, because with each cell division diatom cells become progressively smaller. As a result, the older the diatom cell, the smaller it is. This is an interesting thing, that each daughter cell is smaller than the parent. The daughter cell forms a new silica cell wall inside the parent, but the rigid glass cell wall cannot expand. The baby is stuck, for its entire life, being smaller than the mom. Not only that, each daughter cell has one valve (half of a diatom cell) donated by the parent and one valve that is newly formed. So at this point, things get philosophical. If a parent diatom cell divides and gives one cell wall to one daughter and the other cell wall to the other daughter, does the parent still exist?</p>

The raphe is located between the longitudinal ribs. At the valve terminus, the ribs form a single tip, or porte-crayon. The proximal and distal raphe ends are not clearly observed with light microscopy. Living cells possess one H-shaped plastid. Frustulia grows in benthic habitats as single cells or as colonies in mucilaginous tubes. Species of Frustulia are widespread in North America. Cells reach their greatest abundance in waters such as seepage lakes where the water is slightly acidic, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is high, and specific conductivity is relatively low.</p>

							<p>Mallomonas is a genus comprising unicellular algal eukaryotes and characterized by their intricate cell coverings made of silica scales and bristles. The group was first named and classified by Dr. Maximilian Perty in 1852. These organisms live in freshwater and are widely distributed around the world. Some well known species include Mallomonas caudata and Mallomonas splendens. Mallomonas is a genus of many from the phylum Ochrophyta, which describes organisms as having heterokont flagella in some part of their life history. At first, the family Mallomonadaceae was placed under class Chrysophyceae. However, after finding key biochemical and ultrastructural differences, the family was then placed under the class Synurophyceae. In a broader context, both Chrysophyceae and Synurophyceae are referred to as “chrysophytes”, meaning “golden algae”, because of their close similarities. Despite being quite similar, there are various, noticeable differences. </p>

							<h3>Synura sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Species of Synura form microscopic, spherical colonies, composed of multiple cells attached to each other at the center of the colony. Synura cells are variously shaped, typically spherical to pear-shaped or club-shaped. Each cell contains two plastids aligned with the long axis of the cell; they impart a distinctive golden color to the cells, which comes from chlorophyll c1 and fucoxanthin. Cells are covered with scales made of silica. Two flagella are present. Identification of species depends on the morphology of the scales. For many species, a positive identification is only possible with an electron microscope, either with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or transmission electron microscopy (TEM).</p>

							<h3>Eunotia sp unknown</h3>
							<p>In girdle view, Eunotia has a rectangular shape. In valve view, Eunotia is asymmetrical along the apical axis, with a convex dorsal margin and a straight or concave ventral margin. Eunotia has a short raphe system, with raphe slits that are often rudimentary and lie to one side of the primary pattern center. Eunotia is a freshwater diatom that is commonly found in lakes, but can also be found in marine, brackish, and terrestrial environments. Eunotia is often associated with acidic waters and oligotrophic or dystrophic situations. Eunotia is common in fossil records, although their siliceous wall design may have been lost. There are around 200 species of Eunotia. </p>

							<h3>Surirella sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Cells of Surirella grow as single, isolated cells. The frustules may be either isopolar or heteropolar. Like other genera within the family Surirellaceae, the raphe system is positioned along the margin of the valve. The raphe is located within a canal, which may be raised above the valve surface in some species. Cells may be highly silicified, with spines and silica nodules on the valve surface. Species in Surirella are common in the benthos, especially epipelic habitats, across a wide range of water chemistry. Cells may be relatively small, to very large (a few hundred micrometers), depending on the species. Because of the extensive raphe system, species of Surirella have high motility as compared to other diatom genera. They are able to live within sand grains and fine sediment, and can move through the sediment by means of the raphe system.</p>

							<h3>Nassula sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Nassula is a genus of unicellular ciliates, belonging to the class Nassophorea. Like other members of the class, Nassula possesses a basket-like feeding apparatus (nasse, or cyrtos) made up of cytopharyngeal rods (nematodesmata), which are themselves composed of closely packed microtubules. Nassula use this structure to ingest filamentous cyanobacteria, drawing individual strands of blue-green algae through the cytopharynx and into the body of the cell, where they are digested. As the algae are broken down, they can take on a variety of bright colours, which give Nassula a distinctive, variegated appearance under the microscope.</p>
