							<h3>Euplotes sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Euplotes cells are inflexible, dorsoventrally flattened, and roughly ovoid, with a very large oral region (peristome) bordered on the left by a long "adoral zone of membranelles" (AZM). Like other spirotrich ciliates, Euplotes move and feed with the help of compound ciliary organelles called "cirri," made up of thick tufts of cilia sparsely distributed on the cell. Strong cirri on the ventral surface of the cell enable Euplotes to walk or crawl on submerged detritus and vegetation. All species of Euplotes have a group of stiff bristles (caudal cirri), which protrude from the posterior of the cell. The number of caudal cirri varies, even within a species, but it is most common for Euplotes to have 4 or 5. The macronucleus is typically long and narrow, and approximately horseshoe-shaped, C-shaped, or resembling the number 3.</p>

							<h3>Stentor pyriformis</h3>
							<p>Stentor pyriformis represents a green, short, and fat Stentor, but it is a little-known species. We investigated 124 ponds and wetlands in Japan and confirmed the presence of S. pyriformis at 23 locations. All these ponds were noticeably oligotrophic. With the improvement of oligotrophic culture conditions, we succeeded in long-term cultivation of three strains of S. pyriformis. The cytoplasm of S. piriformis contains a large number of 1–3 μm refractive granules that turn brown by Lugol’s staining. The granules also show a typical Maltese-cross pattern by polarization microscopy, strongly suggesting that the granules are made of amylopectin-rich starch. By analyzing the algal rDNA, it was found that all S. pyriformis symbionts investigated in this study were Chlorella variabilis. This species is known as the symbiont of Paramecium bursaria and is physiologically specialized for endosymbiosis. Genetic discrepancies between C. variabilis of S. pyriformis and P. bursaria may indicate that algal sharing was an old incident. Having symbiotic algae and storing carbohydrate granules in the cytoplasm is considered a powerful strategy for this ciliate to withstand oligotrophic and cold winter environments in highland bogs.</p>

							<h3>Centroheliozoa</h3>
							<p>Individuals are unicellular and spherical, usually around 30–80 μm in diameter, and covered with long radial axopods, narrow cellular projections that capture food and allow mobile forms to move about. A few genera have no cell covering, but most have a gelatinous coat holding scales and spines, produced in special deposition vesicles. These may be organic or siliceous and come in various shapes and sizes. For instance, in Raphidiophrys the coat extends along the bases of the axopods, covering them with curved spicules that give them a pine-treeish look, and in Raphidiocystis there are both short cup-shaped spicules and long tubular spicules that are only a little shorter than the axopods. Some other common genera include Heterophrys, Actinocystis, and Oxnerella. The axopods of centrohelids are supported by microtubules in a triangular-hexagonal array, which arise from a tripartite granule called the centroplast at the center of the cell. Axopods with a similar array occur in gymnosphaerids, which have traditionally been considered centrohelids (though sometimes in a separate order from the others). This was questioned when it was found they have mitochondria with tubular cristae, as do other heliozoa, while in centrohelids the cristae are flat. Although this is no longer considered a very reliable character, on balance gymnosphaerids seem to be a separate group. </p>

							<h3>Complex Paramecium bursaria</h3>
							<p>Paramecium bursaria is a species of ciliate found in marine and brackish waters. It has a mutualistic endosymbiotic relationship with green algae called Zoochlorella. About 700 Chlorella cells live inside the protist's cytoplasm and provide it with food, while the Paramecium provides the algae with movement and protection. P. bursaria is 80-150 μm long, with a wide oral groove, two contractile vacuoles, and a single micronucleus as well as a single macronucleus. P. bursaria is the only species of Paramecium that forms symbiotic relationships with algae, and it is often used in biology classrooms both as an example of a protozoan and also as an example of symbiosis.</p>

							<h3>Navicula sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Navicula is a genus of boat-shaped diatom (single-celled photosynthetic organisms), comprising over 1,200 species, though many Navicula species likely do not belong in the genus strictly speaking. Navicula is Latin for "small ship", and also a term in English for a boat-shaped incense-holder. Navicula is a cosmopolitan genus and species are present in both freshwater and marine environments, typically attached to surfaces. Navicula species are pennate diatoms. Their valves are typically elliptical, though some species have more pinched ends than others. Navicula cells have two chloroplasts, one along each side of the valve along the girdle bands. Navicula diatoms are highly motile and move through a gliding movement This is done through excretion of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). One form of EPS surrounds the outside of the cell and another is excreted through a slit in the frustule called a raphe, allowing the cell to glide along a track. </p>

							<h3>Cymbella sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Valves are slightly to stongly asymmetrical to the apical axis, and symmetrical to the transapical axis. Species with slight asymmetry may be very close to naviculoid symmetry. The raphe is centrally or eccentrically positioned. Stigmata are absent, or if present, located on the ventral side of the central area. The distal raphe ends are straight or deflected dorsally. Cells grow in benthic habitats, often surrounded by mucilage or producing mucilaginous stalks. Apical pore fields may be absent, or present at both poles. Taxa with apical pore fields are likely to be found growing on stalks. The broad sense of Cymbella embraced here (Krammer, 1982; Krammer and Lange-Bertalot, 1986; Round et al., 1990) is probably not a natural group of taxa. As such, it contains a heterogeneous assemblage of taxa that are not referred to Encyonema or Reimeria. A natural group within Cymbella contains species with ventrally placed stigmata, dorsally deflected external distal raphe ends, and apical pore fields. Krammer's work has led to a broad understanding of the valve (Krammer, 1982), raphe (Krammer, 1979), and girdle components of cymbelloid frustule (Krammer, 1981). Krammer (1997a, b) has begun to revise the genus and identify clusters of morphologically similar species. Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1986) offer an excellent account of common members of the genus. Cymbella is a large genus and is often common in benthic habitats across North America. As a genus, it varies greatly in size and degree of asysmmetry, with some species with only slight asysmmetry to the apical axis. North American species have been considered by Hufford and Collins (1972a, b), Kingston (1978), and Selva (1981). Geitler (1927, 1956, 1967) and Geitler and Mack (1953) have documented sexual reproduction.</p>

							<h3>Nitzschia sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Nitzschia is a common pennate marine diatom. In the scientific literature, this genus, named after Christian Ludwig Nitzsch, is sometimes referred to incorrectly as Nitzchia, and it has many species described, which all have a similar morphology. In its current circumscription, Nitzschia is paraphyletic. Nitzschia is found mostly in colder waters, and is associated with both Arctic and Antarctic polar sea ice, where it is often found to be the dominant diatom. Nitzschia includes several species of diatoms known to produce the neurotoxin known as domoic acid, a toxin responsible for the human illness called amnesic shellfish poisoning. The species N. frigida is found to grow exponentially even at temperatures between −4 and −6 °C. Some Nitzschia species are also extremophiles by dint of tolerance to high salinity; for example, some halophilic species of Nitzschia are found in the Makgadikgadi Pans in Botswana.</p>

							<h3>Spirostomum sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Spirostomum is a medium to large worm-like (vermiform) elongated ciliate, ranging from around 150 μm to 4 mm and is large enough to be confused with small helminths. It moves by gliding slowly over or swimming freely above the substrate. It possesses tubular or somewhat flattened bodies, with colours ranging from a faint brown or yellow, to green. The organism is bound externally by a thin layer of ectoplasm while the endoplasm consists of large vacuoles separated by a mesh of fluid protoplasm. Cells are often hosts of prokaryotic and eukaryotic symbionts.</p>
