							<h3>Euplotes sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Euplotes cells are inflexible, dorsoventrally flattened, and roughly ovoid, with a very large oral region (peristome) bordered on the left by a long "adoral zone of membranelles" (AZM). Like other spirotrich ciliates, Euplotes move and feed with the help of compound ciliary organelles called "cirri," made up of thick tufts of cilia sparsely distributed on the cell. Strong cirri on the ventral surface of the cell enable Euplotes to walk or crawl on submerged detritus and vegetation. All species of Euplotes have a group of stiff bristles (caudal cirri), which protrude from the posterior of the cell. The number of caudal cirri varies, even within a species, but it is most common for Euplotes to have 4 or 5. The macronucleus is typically long and narrow, and approximately horseshoe-shaped, C-shaped, or resembling the number 3.</p>

							<h3>Tabellaria fenestrata</h3>
							<p>Tabellaria fenestrata is usually found in circumneutral waters, especially mesotrophic-eutrophic ponds and lakes. This species can be planktonic (Krammer and Lange-Bertalot 1991) or growing attached to vegetation or other hard substrates (Knudson 1952, Koppen 1975). The colonies form long straight chains; they are rarely found in zig-zag or star-like formations (Knudson 1952, Koppen 1975).</p>

							<h3>Gomphonema truncatum</h3>
							<p>Valves are clavate, with a tumid center. A constriction at the headpole and broad apex creates a distinctly capitate headpole. The footpole is narrow and rounded. The axial area is straight and expanded on either side of the axial area to form a “bow-tie” shaped central area. A single, rounded external stigma opening is present in the central area. The raphe is lateral and undulate, with expanded external proximal ends. Striae are radiate, indistinctly punctate, and become parallel toward the headpole. Striae are strongly radiate at the footpole. A distinct apical pore field is present at the footpole. Septa and pseudosepta are present at the poles.</p>

							<h3>Vorticellidae</h3>
							<p>Vorticellidae is a family of ciliates belonging to the order Sessilida. They are colonial or unicellular organisms that are attached to a substrate via a stalk. The distinguishing characteristic of the family is a helical spasmoneme within the stalk that is contractile. Members of this family are common in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats around the world.</p>

							<h3>Stentor pyriformis</h3>
							<p>Stentor pyriformis represents a green, short, and fat Stentor, but it is a little-known species. We investigated 124 ponds and wetlands in Japan and confirmed the presence of S. pyriformis at 23 locations. All these ponds were noticeably oligotrophic. With the improvement of oligotrophic culture conditions, we succeeded in long-term cultivation of three strains of S. pyriformis. The cytoplasm of S. piriformis contains a large number of 1–3 μm refractive granules that turn brown by Lugol’s staining. The granules also show a typical Maltese-cross pattern by polarization microscopy, strongly suggesting that the granules are made of amylopectin-rich starch. By analyzing the algal rDNA, it was found that all S. pyriformis symbionts investigated in this study were Chlorella variabilis. This species is known as the symbiont of Paramecium bursaria and is physiologically specialized for endosymbiosis. Genetic discrepancies between C. variabilis of S. pyriformis and P. bursaria may indicate that algal sharing was an old incident. Having symbiotic algae and storing carbohydrate granules in the cytoplasm is considered a powerful strategy for this ciliate to withstand oligotrophic and cold winter environments in highland bogs.</p>

							<h3>Pinnularia sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Pinnularia is a genus of freshwater diatoms, characterized by their elongated, elliptical shape, with a cell wall primarily composed of silica and featuring a prominent "raphe" (a slit-like structure) running along the central axis of the valve, making them easily identifiable under a microscope; they typically have two large chloroplasts per cell and are often found in ponds and moist soil environments.Elliptical, often with slightly rounded ends, appearing linear in valve view.Composed of silica, with intricate patterns of striae (fine lines) across the valve surface. A prominent central raphe, with the proximal ends often deflected to one side.Two large chloroplasts per cell, extending along the length of the valve. Identifying Pinnularia species often requires detailed examination of the valve features like the shape, striae pattern, and raphe structure under a microscope. Due to their sensitivity to environmental factors, Pinnularia can be used as indicators of water quality in aquatic ecosystems.</p>

							<h3>Centroheliozoa</h3>
							<p>Individuals are unicellular and spherical, usually around 30–80 μm in diameter, and covered with long radial axopods, narrow cellular projections that capture food and allow mobile forms to move about. A few genera have no cell covering, but most have a gelatinous coat holding scales and spines, produced in special deposition vesicles. These may be organic or siliceous and come in various shapes and sizes. For instance, in Raphidiophrys the coat extends along the bases of the axopods, covering them with curved spicules that give them a pine-treeish look, and in Raphidiocystis there are both short cup-shaped spicules and long tubular spicules that are only a little shorter than the axopods. Some other common genera include Heterophrys, Actinocystis, and Oxnerella. The axopods of centrohelids are supported by microtubules in a triangular-hexagonal array, which arise from a tripartite granule called the centroplast at the center of the cell. Axopods with a similar array occur in gymnosphaerids, which have traditionally been considered centrohelids (though sometimes in a separate order from the others). This was questioned when it was found they have mitochondria with tubular cristae, as do other heliozoa, while in centrohelids the cristae are flat. Although this is no longer considered a very reliable character, on balance gymnosphaerids seem to be a separate group. </p>
