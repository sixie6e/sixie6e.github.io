							<h3>Cladonia cervicornis ssp. verticillata</h3>
							<p>Cladonia cervicornis ssp. verticillata, also known as ladder lichen, is a cup lichen that is similar to Cladonia cervicornis but has distinct features. Color: Cladonia verticillata is a paler green-grey color, while Cladonia cervicornis is browner. Podetia: Cladonia verticillata has podetia with cups that are arranged in tiers, often stacked in scaffolds of two or three. Cladonia cervicornis has fewer podetions and never multi-storey. Basal squamules Cladonia verticillata has rounded and short basal squamules. Cladonia cervicornis has longer, more indented basal squamules. Habitat: Cladonia verticillata is found in more acidic and damper habitats than Cladonia cervicornis. It is typically found on sandy soil in aerohaline healthlands. Cladonia species are economically important to reindeer-herders and some species can be used to create antibiotic cream.</p>

							<h3>Cladonia cristatella & botrytes</h3>
							<p><b>Cladonia cristatella</b>: This lichen can be found growing around the base of trees, and also along dead trees. It can grow up to an inch tall, with stem and branchlike structures in a grayish, green color. At the top of these structures, is a bright red spore-producing body called apothecia that may remind one of the red coats of British soldiers during the American Revolution. This is what gives them their name “British soldier lichen”. Even though the apothecia structures make and spread viable fungi spores, these spores do not carry the alga with them and are thus unable to produce new British soldier lichens. Instead, this lichen, similar to other species of lichens, spreads when pieces of branches fall off and propagate in the same area. Lichens are highly sensitive to moisture, temperature and air pollutants found in the environment and are an excellent monitor of climate and indicator of air quality. Be sure to be on the lookout for British soldier lichen and other lichens while on a walk as they are a sign for a healthy ecosystem and a successful relationship between fungi and alga. <b>Cladonia botrytes</b>: Its primary thallus squamulose, the squamules usually persistent but inconspicuous, small, up to 1.5(-2) mm long, widening and crenate to laciniate at apex, ascending, yellowish green above, whitish below, esorediate. Podetia yellowish-green to yellowish grey, the bases often slightly melanotic, subcylindrical, simple or sparingly dichotomously branched in upper parts, widening toward the tip below the apothecia, 5-30 mm tall, 0.3-1.5 mm thick, simple or sparingly branched toward apices, cupless, corticate to the base, becoming verruculose-areolate, sometimes longitudinally fissured, often terminated with one or more confluent apothecia, without squamules or rarely with a few small squamules at the base. Apothecia frequent, terminal, pale yellowish brown or pale ochraceous brown, often grouped in small clusters, convex, the clusters up to 4 mm broad. Asci 8-spored, clavate, thickened at apex, with a K/I+ blue tholus and a K/I+ strongly blue outer gelatinous sheath, Cladonia-type. Ascospores 1-celled, hyaline, ellipsoid. Pycnidia semi-immersed on the upper side of the primary squamules or on the sides of the podetia, shortly cylindrical to turbinate, constricted at base, pale brown, with a colourless jelly. Conidia hyaline, curved. Photobiont chlorococcoid. Spot tests: K-, C-, KC+ yellowish, or KC-, P-, UV-. Chemistry: usnic, barbatic, and 4-O-demethylbarbatic acids.</p>

							<h3>Lobaria pulmonaria</h3>
							<p>Lobaria pulmonaria is a large epiphytic lichen consisting of an ascomycete fungus and a green algal partner living together in a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium — a symbiosis involving members of three kingdoms of organisms. Commonly known by various names like tree lungwort, lung lichen, lung moss, lungwort lichen, oak lungs or oak lungwort, it is sensitive to air pollution and is also harmed by habitat loss and changes in forestry practices. Its population has declined across Europe and L. pulmonaria is considered endangered in many lowland areas. The species has a history of use in herbal medicines, and recent research has corroborated some medicinal properties of lichen extracts. </p>

							<h3>Leotia viscosa</h3>
							<p>Saprobic fungi found in small clusters growing near conifers, on decaying hardwood or humus. Also found growing near moss. Can be found between late spring and fall with a wide distribution in North America. Cap is dark green and ranges from 1-3 cm in diameter. Has a viscid cap early on, hence its Latin name “viscosa,” translates to sticky. Stem reaches up to 6 cm in height, is white in color, and turns yellow as the mushroom matures. This mushroom shares similar characteristics to L. lubrica studies suggest that the cap color is not a reliable way to determine this species, as its relatives L. lubrica and L. atrovirens are polyphyletic; therefore observation at the molecular level is needed (Zhong and Pfister 2004).</p>

							<p>The hard, coral-like fruiting bodies reach 4–10 centimetres (1+1⁄2–4 in) tall. The colour ranges from cream to semi-tan. The branches rise in ringlike arrangements resembling a crown. Basidia and basidiospores are produced on the surfaces of the branches. The spore print is white. The sesquiterpene compounds pyxidatols A-C, tsuicoline E and omphadiol have been obtained from the liquid culture of this fungus. Although usually found in insubstantial quantities, these fungi are considered edible raw, but are better cooked. According to one guide, it is best served when fried with chopped potatoes. The fungus are known to be served as meal amongst the tribal groups of Northeast India since time immemorial.</p>

							<h3>Cladonia pocillum</h3>
							<p>Cladonia pocillum is a Pixie Cup with cups similar to C. pyxidata, with only corticate granules and no soredia or decorticate granules. The species are separated by the very different basal squamules, with C. pocillum having  well developed, ± horizontally spreading, contiguous and overlapping brown-green basal squamules, which tend to radiate at the margins to form ± imbricate, compact rosettes. Cladonia pyxidata in contrast has typically rather small basal squamules, that are rounded or elongate, with few indentations, often becoming ± erect when abundant. The development of C. pocillum basal squamules is influenced by the roughness of the substate; they are best developed on open ground and more broken up when over growing robust mosses. The status of C. pocillum in relation to C. pyxidata is still unclear, although distinctive, it may be a calcicole ecotype of C. pyxidata.</p>

							<h3>Multiclavula mucida</h3>
							<p>Multiclavula mucida is a globally distributed species of basidiolichen belonging to the family Hydnaceae. Since its initial classification by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1797, the species has been described under various synonyms and associated with multiple genera. Persoon described its fruiting bodies as gregarious (i.e. growing in groups but separate at the base), varying from simple to branching structures, predominantly whitish in colour with yellow to brownish tips. He also noted its frequent appearance in autumn on decaying, moist wood, often covered with a greenish crust necessary for its growth. The cosmopolitan distribution of Multiclavula mucida and its variability in appearance have led to a complex nomenclature and historical confusion with other species and genera. Though widespread, it is considered rare in Europe and faces threats in many countries. It can be distinguished from similar species such as Multiclavula petricola, M. vernalis, M. coronilla, and Clavicorona taxophila by differences in basidiospore size, growth substrate, fruiting body structure, and microscopic features, despite similarities in colour and general form. </p>

							<p>Bisporella citrina, commonly known as yellow fairy cups or lemon discos, is a species of fungus in the family Helotiaceae. The fungus produces tiny yellow cups up to 3 mm (1⁄8 in) in diameter, often without stalks, that fruit in groups or dense clusters on decaying deciduous wood that has lost its bark. The widely distributed species is found in North Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and Central and South America. Found in late summer and autumn, the fungus is fairly common, but is easily overlooked owing to its small size. There are several similar species that can in most cases be distinguished by differences in color, morphology, or substrate. Microscopically, B. citrina can be distinguished from these lookalikes by its elliptical spores, which have a central partition, and an oil drop at each end. </p>

							<h3>Tremella mesenterica</h3>
							<p>Tremella mesenterica (common names include yellow brain, golden jelly fungus, yellow trembler, and witches' butter is a common jelly fungus in the family Tremellaceae of the Agaricomycotina. The gelatinous, orange-yellow fruit body of the fungus, which can grow up to 7.5 cm (3 in) diameter, has a convoluted or lobed surface that is greasy or slimy when damp. It is most frequently found on both dead but attached and recently fallen branches, especially of angiosperms, as a parasite of wood decay fungi in the genus Peniophora. It also grows in crevices in bark, appearing during rainy weather. Within a few days after rain it dries into a thin film or shriveled mass capable of reviving after subsequent rain. This fungus occurs widely in deciduous and mixed forests and is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions, including those of Africa, Australia, Eurasia, and the Americas. Although considered bland and flavorless, the fungus is edible. It produces carbohydrates that have attracted research interest because of their various biological activities. /p>

							<h3>Cladonia</h3>
							<p>Cladonia is a genus of moss-like lichenized fungi in the family Cladoniaceae. They are the primary food source for reindeer/caribou. Cladonia species are of economic importance to reindeer-herders, such as the Sami in Scandinavia or the Nenets in Russia. Antibiotic compounds are extracted from some species to create antibiotic cream. The light green species Cladonia stellaris is used in flower decorations. Although the phylogeny of the genus Cladonia is still under investigation, two main morphological groups are commonly differentiated by taxonomists: the Cladonia morpho-type and the Cladina morpho-type. The Cladonia morpho-type has many more species, and is generally described as a group of squamulose (grow from squamules), cup-bearing lichens. The Cladina morpho-types are often referred to as forage lichens, mat-forming lichens, or reindeer lichens (due to their importance as caribou winter forage). Cladonia perforata ("perforate cladonia") is one of two on the U.S. Endangered Species List, and it should never be collected. It exists only in a few small populations in Florida. Several Cladonia species grow on sand dunes. The presence, and luxuriant carpet-like growth, of Cladonia species is one of the defining characters of grey dune, a priority habitat for conservation under the E.U. Habitats Directive. Cladonia species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Chionodes continuella. </p>

							<h3>Calyptella sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Calyptella is a genus of Cyphelloid fungi in the family Marasmiaceae. The genus has a widespread distribution and contains 20 species. These fungi grow on bark of trees or on the stems of herbaceous plants (generally when they are already dead). The fruiting bodies are shaped like bells which hang down from a point of attachment, sometimes with short stems. The smooth fertile surface is on the interior of the bell shape.</p>

							<h3>Xeromphalina campanella</h3>
							<p>Xeromphalina campanella is a species of mushroom. The common names of the species include the golden trumpet and the bell Omphalina. The genus name Xeromphalina means "little dry navel" and campanella means "bell-shaped", respectively describing the mature and young shapes of the pileus, or cap. The mushroom is also called fuzzy-foot. The fruit body of X. campanella has a small umbrella-shaped cap, about .5–2 cm wide. The thin brown stalk is 1–5 cm long and 1–3 mm wide, yellow at the apex, reddish brown below, with brown or yellow hairs at the base. The gills are pale yellow to pale orange. The spore print is pale buff. When the species is young, their caps are bell-shaped. As they mature, the outer part of the cap expands and rises which leaves the center depressed, resembling a navel. Although the species is not poisonous, the mushrooms are small and bitter tasting with no value as edibles. David Arora suggests that the mushroom is a small morsel that is hardly worth eating. Despite many authors calling the mushroom inedible, author Bill Russell knows people that eat the mushroom frequently.</p>

							<h3>Phlebia radiata</h3>
							<p>The fruitbody of Phlebia radiata is resupinate—flattened against its substrate like a crust. It is wrinkled, orange to pinkish in color, and has a waxy texture. It is circular to irregular in shape, reaching a diameter up to 10 cm (3.9 in), although neighbouring fruitbodies may be fused together to form larger complexes up to 30 cm (12 in) in diameter. The soft texture of the flesh hardens when the fruitbody becomes old. The fungus is inedible. In mass, the spores are white. Microscopic examination reveals additional spore details: they are smooth, allantoid (sausage-shaped) to elliptical, and inamyloid, measuring 3.5–7 by 1–3 μm. Similar species include Botryobasidium vagum, Meruliporia incrassata, Piloderma bicolor, and Serpula lacrymans.</p>

							<h3>Arthonia sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Arthonia species are typically crustose lichens, forming thin, often inconspicuous patches that can be either flush with the surface (immersed) or sitting on top (superficial). The thallus—the main body of the lichen—may spread without clear boundaries or sometimes be neatly outlined by thin brown lines. In some species, the thallus may be absent altogether. Under chemical tests, the fungal filaments (hyphae) in the thallus can show distinctive reactions, turning red or pale blue when stained with iodine (I+) and then blue with a potassium iodine (K/I) solution. The photosynthetic partner (photobiont) is most commonly a green alga belonging to the genus Trentepohlia. In some cases, however, a less well-known type of green alga is involved, and a few species are only weakly lichenised or even live partly by breaking down dead organic matter (saprophytic) or parasitising other lichens (lichenicolous). The reproductive structures of Arthonia are ascomata, which are often similar to apothecia (open, disc-like fruiting bodies) but can have a wide range of shapes. They may be round, elongated, linear, or even star-shaped, and on bark they often develop a subtle, thin rim of tissue that includes both lichen and host bark cells. The exposed surface of these structures (the disc) can be reddish-brown to black, and sometimes appears dusted with pale or white powder (pruina). Unlike many lichens, Arthonia usually lacks a thalline exciple (a protective rim made of thallus tissue) and often also lacks a true exciple (a layer of fungal tissue), though a few species develop a well-defined, carbonised boundary. Internally, the top layer (epithecium) can range from colourless to reddish or dark brown. The main spore-producing region (hymenium) typically reacts to the same chemical tests as the thallus hyphae, and these reactions help distinguish Arthonia from other lichens. Beneath the hymenium, a distinct hypothecium (a supporting layer) may be absent or difficult to separate from the hymenium. Thread-like fungal elements (paraphysoids) weave through a gel-like matrix, becoming more intricately branched and pigmented near their tips, where they often form small, dark "caps". The asci, or spore-bearing cells, usually contain eight spores and have a characteristic Arthonia-type structure. They are often semi-fissitunicate (splitting in a controlled way when releasing spores) and possess a large, domed apex with a specialised "ocular chamber" that may show subtle colour changes with chemical tests. The ascospores themselves are typically oval or elongated, divided into one to seven segments (septa), and start off colourless and smooth. As they mature and age, they may darken and become slightly roughened. Initially, the spores can have a very thin, colourless outer layer (epispore). In addition to sexual reproduction via ascospores, Arthonia often produces tiny, inconspicuous, flask-shaped structures called pycnidia. These generate small, colourless, single-celled spores (conidia) that are usually rod-shaped but occasionally ellipsoidal or thread-like. From a chemical standpoint, many Arthonia species do not contain distinct lichen products, but others produce a variety of substances, including xanthones and certain anthraquinones. These chemical differences, along with the various structural features, help distinguish different species within the genus.</p>

							<h3>Camposporium sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Saprobic on decaying wood, bark and fruit of various trees and shrubs in terrestrial or freshwater habitats. Sexual morph: Undetermined. Asexual morph: Colonies effuse, grey, brown to black. Mycelium immersed or partly superficial on host substrate. Conidiophores macro- or micronematous, mononematous, often short, straight or irregularly bent, unbranched, pale brown to dark brown. Conidiogenous cells mono- or polyblastic, integrated, terminal, sympodial, cylindrical or subulate, denticulate. Conidia solitary, dry, multiseptate, pale brown, often unevenly coloured, the end cells subhyaline, smooth, mostly cylindrical, rounded or tapering at the apex, sometimes rostrate, with or without appendages (Ellis 1971; Hyde et al. 2020). Camposporium is an old genus and characterized by short conidiophores, denticulate conidiogenous cells, and cylindrical, multi-septate, uneven coloured conidia often with single or several cylindrical appendages (Ellis 1971; Hyde et al. 2020). Camposporium had a relationship with Fusiconidium Jun F. Li et al., but they can be distinguished by conidiogenous cells and conidial shape (Li et al. 2017; Hyde et al. 2020b). They are treated as distinct genera until their relationships are well-resolved (Hyde et al. 2020b). The type species, C. antennatum, represented by a strain CBS 113441 was placed in Melanommataceae (Hyde et al. 2020). Other Camposporium species clustered with C. antennatum, but with low bootstrap support (Hyde et al. 2020). A freshwater species C. septatum N.G. Liu et al. formed a well-supported clade with Fusiconidium species (Hyde et al. 2020). However, C. septatum was placed in Camposporium, rather than Fusiconidium, based on its monoblastic conidiogenous cells and cylindrical conidia with several appendages at the apex (Hyde et al. 2020). Both C. appendiculatum D.F. Bao et al. and C. multiseptatum D.F. Bao et al. have tapering apical cell with truncate ends, while C. antennatum has rounded apex (Ellis 1971; Hyde et al. 2020). Camposporium hyalinum Abdullah and C. marylandicum Shearer have the typical apical appendages of Camposporium, but they have hyaline conidia which are different from the brown, unevenly coloured conidia of the other freshwater species (Shearer 1974; Abdullah 1980; Hyde et al. 2020). The molecular data of these two species are needed to confirm their phylogenetic placement. Camposporium species need further study with more collections. Camposporium dulciaquae was the latest addition to the genus from a freshwater stream in Thailand (Calabon et al. 2021).</p>
