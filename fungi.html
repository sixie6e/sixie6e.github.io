							<h3>Cladonia cervicornis ssp. verticillata</h3>
							<p>Cladonia cervicornis ssp. verticillata, also known as ladder lichen, is a cup lichen that is similar to Cladonia cervicornis but has distinct features. Color: Cladonia verticillata is a paler green-grey color, while Cladonia cervicornis is browner. Podetia: Cladonia verticillata has podetia with cups that are arranged in tiers, often stacked in scaffolds of two or three. Cladonia cervicornis has fewer podetions and never multi-storey. Basal squamules Cladonia verticillata has rounded and short basal squamules. Cladonia cervicornis has longer, more indented basal squamules. Habitat: Cladonia verticillata is found in more acidic and damper habitats than Cladonia cervicornis. It is typically found on sandy soil in aerohaline healthlands. Cladonia species are economically important to reindeer-herders and some species can be used to create antibiotic cream.</p>

							<h3>Cladonia cristatella & botrytes</h3>
							<p><b>Cladonia cristatella</b>: This lichen can be found growing around the base of trees, and also along dead trees. It can grow up to an inch tall, with stem and branchlike structures in a grayish, green color. At the top of these structures, is a bright red spore-producing body called apothecia that may remind one of the red coats of British soldiers during the American Revolution. This is what gives them their name “British soldier lichen”. Even though the apothecia structures make and spread viable fungi spores, these spores do not carry the alga with them and are thus unable to produce new British soldier lichens. Instead, this lichen, similar to other species of lichens, spreads when pieces of branches fall off and propagate in the same area. Lichens are highly sensitive to moisture, temperature and air pollutants found in the environment and are an excellent monitor of climate and indicator of air quality. Be sure to be on the lookout for British soldier lichen and other lichens while on a walk as they are a sign for a healthy ecosystem and a successful relationship between fungi and alga. <b>Cladonia botrytes</b>: Its primary thallus squamulose, the squamules usually persistent but inconspicuous, small, up to 1.5(-2) mm long, widening and crenate to laciniate at apex, ascending, yellowish green above, whitish below, esorediate. Podetia yellowish-green to yellowish grey, the bases often slightly melanotic, subcylindrical, simple or sparingly dichotomously branched in upper parts, widening toward the tip below the apothecia, 5-30 mm tall, 0.3-1.5 mm thick, simple or sparingly branched toward apices, cupless, corticate to the base, becoming verruculose-areolate, sometimes longitudinally fissured, often terminated with one or more confluent apothecia, without squamules or rarely with a few small squamules at the base. Apothecia frequent, terminal, pale yellowish brown or pale ochraceous brown, often grouped in small clusters, convex, the clusters up to 4 mm broad. Asci 8-spored, clavate, thickened at apex, with a K/I+ blue tholus and a K/I+ strongly blue outer gelatinous sheath, Cladonia-type. Ascospores 1-celled, hyaline, ellipsoid. Pycnidia semi-immersed on the upper side of the primary squamules or on the sides of the podetia, shortly cylindrical to turbinate, constricted at base, pale brown, with a colourless jelly. Conidia hyaline, curved. Photobiont chlorococcoid. Spot tests: K-, C-, KC+ yellowish, or KC-, P-, UV-. Chemistry: usnic, barbatic, and 4-O-demethylbarbatic acids.</p>

							<h3>Lobaria pulmonaria</h3>
							<p>Lobaria pulmonaria is a large epiphytic lichen consisting of an ascomycete fungus and a green algal partner living together in a symbiotic relationship with a cyanobacterium — a symbiosis involving members of three kingdoms of organisms. Commonly known by various names like tree lungwort, lung lichen, lung moss, lungwort lichen, oak lungs or oak lungwort, it is sensitive to air pollution and is also harmed by habitat loss and changes in forestry practices. Its population has declined across Europe and L. pulmonaria is considered endangered in many lowland areas. The species has a history of use in herbal medicines, and recent research has corroborated some medicinal properties of lichen extracts. </p>

							<h3>Leotia viscosa</h3>
							<p>Saprobic fungi found in small clusters growing near conifers, on decaying hardwood or humus. Also found growing near moss. Can be found between late spring and fall with a wide distribution in North America. Cap is dark green and ranges from 1-3 cm in diameter. Has a viscid cap early on, hence its Latin name “viscosa,” translates to sticky. Stem reaches up to 6 cm in height, is white in color, and turns yellow as the mushroom matures. This mushroom shares similar characteristics to L. lubrica studies suggest that the cap color is not a reliable way to determine this species, as its relatives L. lubrica and L. atrovirens are polyphyletic; therefore observation at the molecular level is needed (Zhong and Pfister 2004).</p>

							<p>The hard, coral-like fruiting bodies reach 4–10 centimetres (1+1⁄2–4 in) tall. The colour ranges from cream to semi-tan. The branches rise in ringlike arrangements resembling a crown. Basidia and basidiospores are produced on the surfaces of the branches. The spore print is white. The sesquiterpene compounds pyxidatols A-C, tsuicoline E and omphadiol have been obtained from the liquid culture of this fungus. Although usually found in insubstantial quantities, these fungi are considered edible raw, but are better cooked. According to one guide, it is best served when fried with chopped potatoes. The fungus are known to be served as meal amongst the tribal groups of Northeast India since time immemorial.</p>

							<h3>Cladonia pocillum</h3>
							<p>Cladonia pocillum is a Pixie Cup with cups similar to C. pyxidata, with only corticate granules and no soredia or decorticate granules. The species are separated by the very different basal squamules, with C. pocillum having  well developed, ± horizontally spreading, contiguous and overlapping brown-green basal squamules, which tend to radiate at the margins to form ± imbricate, compact rosettes. Cladonia pyxidata in contrast has typically rather small basal squamules, that are rounded or elongate, with few indentations, often becoming ± erect when abundant. The development of C. pocillum basal squamules is influenced by the roughness of the substate; they are best developed on open ground and more broken up when over growing robust mosses. The status of C. pocillum in relation to C. pyxidata is still unclear, although distinctive, it may be a calcicole ecotype of C. pyxidata.</p>

							<h3>Multiclavula mucida</h3>
							<p>Multiclavula mucida is a globally distributed species of basidiolichen belonging to the family Hydnaceae. Since its initial classification by Christiaan Hendrik Persoon in 1797, the species has been described under various synonyms and associated with multiple genera. Persoon described its fruiting bodies as gregarious (i.e. growing in groups but separate at the base), varying from simple to branching structures, predominantly whitish in colour with yellow to brownish tips. He also noted its frequent appearance in autumn on decaying, moist wood, often covered with a greenish crust necessary for its growth. The cosmopolitan distribution of Multiclavula mucida and its variability in appearance have led to a complex nomenclature and historical confusion with other species and genera. Though widespread, it is considered rare in Europe and faces threats in many countries. It can be distinguished from similar species such as Multiclavula petricola, M. vernalis, M. coronilla, and Clavicorona taxophila by differences in basidiospore size, growth substrate, fruiting body structure, and microscopic features, despite similarities in colour and general form. </p>

The coral "arms" are sparingly branched (3–4 times), 2–4 mm wide, smooth, and sometimes wrinkled longitudinally.

The fruit bodies have no distinctive odor, and a mild taste. The fruit bodies may have a darker color either due to natural variation (whereby the appearance of this species may approach and be confused with C. cinerea) or because of infection by a microscopic fungus, Helminthosphaeria clavariarum.</p>
