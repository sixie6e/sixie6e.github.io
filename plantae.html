							<h3>Cosmarium sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Cosmarium, with few exceptions, consists of single cells and is thus microscopic. Cells are constricted in the middle, giving them a bilobed appearance; the two halves are called semicells. Cells come in a variety of different shapes. The cell wall may be smooth or ornamented with spines, granules, scrobiculations (pits), or pores. Cells are generally flattened. Cells usually have one or two chloroplasts filling the cell; each chloroplast contains pyrenoids, typically one or two.Species identification of Cosmarium depends on the shape of the cells and their ornamentation, and can be difficult. In addition, the genera Actinotaenium and Euastrum can be similar to various species of Cosmarium. Actinotaenium is generally circular in cross section, and Euastrum usually (but not always) has a notch at the tip of each semicell.</p>

							<h3>Cosmarium regnesi</h3>
							<p>Cosmarium regnesi is a microscopic, unicellular green alga. The cells are divided across an isthmus into two mirrored parts called semicells. The semicells are each roughly rectangular with large granules at the angles and along some of the margins. Cosmarium regnesi is relatively small but quite distinct. It could be mistaken for an isolated cell of Teilingia.</p>

							<h3>Closterium navicula</h3>
							<p>Closterium navicula navicula boasts several captivating physical traits. Its cells are elongated and triangular in cross-section, measuring approximately 20 to 100 micrometers long. The surface is covered with intricate patterns that can vary in texture, making it an aesthetic addition to the microscopic realm. The green hue is primarily due to the presence of chlorophyll, which allows it to perform photosynthesis. One of the distinguishing features of Closterium navicula navicula is its unique cell structure. With two symmetrical halves (semi-cell structures), it resembles a two-lobed boat. Each lobe has appendages known as stigma—these are light-sensitive organelles that aid in movement towards light sources, enhancing their ability to photosynthesize. The complex ornamentation on the surface and the distinctive cell wall morphology can also serve as identification markers. The ecological role of Closterium navicula navicula cannot be overstated. This algae is a vital component of the aquatic ecosystem, serving as a primary producer. Through photosynthesis, it converts sunlight into energy, releasing oxygen as a by-product. This oxygenation is critical for the survival of various aquatic life forms, including fish and other microorganisms. Moreover, as a food source, it supports a diverse array of herbivores and, subsequently, predators within the food chain. </p>

							<h3>Tetradesmus obliquus</h3>
							<p>is a green algae species of the family Scenedesmaceae. It is commonly known by its synonym, Scenedesmus obliquus. It is a common species found in a variety of freshwater habitats. Tetradesmus obliquus forms colonies of two or four (occasionally eight) cells in a single row; in culture, solitary cells are often present. Cells are spindle-shaped, (4–)6–15(–25) μm long and 2.2–9.6(–11) μm wide; cells taper to acute apices and are sometimes slightly asymmetrical. Cells contain a single chloroplast filling the cell, with a pyrenoid present in the center. This chlorophyte species is notable for the genetic coding of its mitochondria which translate TCA as a stop codon and TAG as leucine. This code is represented by NCBI translation table 22, Scenedesmus obliquus mitochondrial code. There is increasing interest in T. obliquus for uses in biotechnology, such as biofuel production, aquaculture, and wastewater treatment. Both growth and photosynthesis of T. obliquus are affected by the presence of nano-sized microplastics, such as nano-polystyrene (nano-PS).</p>

							<h3>Mougeotia sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Mougeotia forms uniserial (one cell thick) chains of cells, called filaments, that are usually unbranched; in certain conditions, it forms branched filaments. Cells are cylindrical, many times longer than wide. Each cell has one or two flat, rectangular and ribbon-shaped chloroplasts that fill the cell. Chloroplasts are able to twist in response to light conditions. The nucleus is located at the center of the cell. Mougeotia is able to reproduce sexually, through a process known as conjugation. It is isogamous, with two different but identically appearing gamete types. In scalariform conjugation, cells of two separate filaments line up parallel to one other. Cells of one filament connect to those of the other via a tube. Species identification depends on observing the morphology of reproductive structures, called zygospores; this is difficult because they are rarely present.</p>

							<p>Stauridium forms flat colonies, termed coenobia, of cells in powers of two, usually four, eight, or 16. Coenobia are disc-shaped in outline, composed of cells laid contiguously next to each other with no spaces in between cells. The marginal cells are trapezoidal, with (in S. tetras) or without (in S. privum) a V-shaped incision in the middle. The cell wall is smooth or covered in granules, warts, or ridges. Cells have one chloroplast filling the cell, each with a single pyrenoid. Species of Stauridium have thin cell walls, so they tend not to preserve well in sediments.</p>

							<h3>Staurastrum sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Staurastrum consists of singular cells with two identical halves, called semicells; in most species, the cell is deeply constricted at the middle, making the division between semicells clear. When viewed from the polar axis, they are biradiate (with two planes of symmetry) or pluriradiate (with more than two planes of symmetry). Biradiate individuals have long, arm-shaped extensions (termed "processes") attached to the main body of the semicells. Pluriradiate individuals may lack these processes. The cell wall is either smooth, or covered with granules or spines. In each semicell there is a chloroplast, usually located axially, with radiating lobes and/or ridges; some species have parietally located chloroplasts.</p>

							<h3>Cosmarium sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Cosmarium is a large genus of desmids (Desmidiaceae), a group of green algae closely related to the land plants (Embryophyta). Members of this genus are microscopic and found in freshwater habitats around the world. The name Cosmarium comes from the Greek roots kosmarion, meaning a small ornament. Cosmarium, with few exceptions, consists of single cells and is thus microscopic. Cells are constricted in the middle, giving them a bilobed appearance; the two halves are called semicells. Cells come in a variety of different shapes. The cell wall may be smooth or ornamented with spines, granules, scrobiculations (pits), or pores. Cells are generally flattened. Cells usually have one or two chloroplasts filling the cell; each chloroplast contains pyrenoids, typically one or two.</p>

							<p>Closterium acerosum is a green algae species that lives in freshwater environments and is characterized by long, straight or slightly curved cells. Cells are 200–500 micrometers long and have prominent band-shaped chloroplasts. They are enclosed in a thin, transparent cellulose cell wall. Closterium acerosum reproduces asexually through binary fission and sexually via gamete production and zygote formation. Closterium acerosum plays a significant role in nutrient cycling and serves as a primary producer in freshwater environments. Closterium acerosum can move using a gliding motion facilitated by a gelatinous sheath. Closterium acerosum is part of the genus Closterium, which is a unicellular alga that inhabits fresh water worldwide. Cells in the genus Closterium are made of two identical halves called semicells.</p>

							<h3>Oedogonium sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Oedogonium is a genus of filamentous, free-living green algae. It was first discovered in the fresh waters of Poland in 1860 by W. Hilse, and later given its name by German scientist K. E. Hirn. The morphology of Oedogonium is unique, with an interior and exterior that function differently from one another and change throughout its life cycle. These algae reside in freshwater ecosystems in both hemispheres and are both benthic and planktonic in nature. They form algal patches on the water's surface and so interact closely with a multitude of other algae. These filamentous cells' life cycles include both sexual and asexual reproduction, depending on the life cycle stage. Although quite common, Oedogonium is difficult to identify since key definitive markers are only present during reproduction, which is an uncommon life stage among this genus. Oedogonium has been found to be important in the fixation of heavy metals in freshwater ecosystems.</p>

							<h3>Mougeotia sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Mougeotia is a genus of filamentous charophyte green algae of the order Zygnematales. It is a common component of freshwater aquatic habitats around the world. Described in 1824 by Carl Adolph Agardh, its name honors the French botanist Jean-Baptiste Mougeot. Mougeotia forms uniserial (one cell thick) chains of cells, called filaments, that are usually unbranched; in certain conditions, it forms branched filaments. Cells are cylindrical, many times longer than wide. Each cell has one or two flat, rectangular and ribbon-shaped chloroplasts that fill the cell. Chloroplasts are able to twist in response to light conditions. The nucleus is located at the center of the cell. Mougeotia is able to reproduce sexually, through a process known as conjugation. It is isogamous, with two different but identically appearing gamete types In scalariform conjugation, cells of two separate filaments line up parallel to one other. Cells of one filament connect to those of the other via a tube.</p>

							<h3>Festuca rubra</h3>
							<p>Festuca rubra is a species of grass known by the common name red fescue, creeping red fescue or the rush-leaf fescue. It is widespread across much of the Northern Hemisphere and can tolerate many habitats and climates. It is best adapted to well-drained soils in cool, temperate climates; it prefers shadier areas and is often planted for its shade tolerance. Wild animals browse it, but it has not been important for domestic forage due to low productivity and palatability. It is also an ornamental plant for gardens. Festuca rubra is perennial and has sub-species that have rhizomes and/or form bunchgrass tufts. It mainly exists in neutral and acidic soils. It can grow between 2 and 20 cm tall. Like all fescues, the leaves are narrow and needle like, making it less palatable to livestock. The swards that it forms are not as tufted as sheep's fescue (Festuca ovina) or wavy hair grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). The tufted nature is what gives the grass its springy characteristic. The leaves are bright green. </p>
