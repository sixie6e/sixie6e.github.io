							<h3>Stauridium tetras</h3>
							<p>Stauridium forms flat colonies, termed coenobia, of cells in powers of two, usually four, eight, or 16. Coenobia are disc-shaped in outline, composed of cells laid contiguously next to each other with no spaces in between cells. The marginal cells are trapezoidal, with (in S. tetras) or without (in S. privum) a V-shaped incision in the middle. The cell wall is smooth or covered in granules, warts, or ridges. Cells have one chloroplast filling the cell, each with a single pyrenoid. Species of Stauridium have thin cell walls, so they tend not to preserve well in sediments.</p>

							<h3>Bambusina borreri</h3>
							<p>Cells barrel-shaped with a slight swelling on either side supporting a shallow constriction. Cell-wall with pores in lines. Chloroplast axil with a single pyrenoid. Found in quite long filamentous chains. Zygospore oblong with smooth walls. Occasionally found in multiple reproductions. Cell dimensions: L: 24-36 µm; B: 16-23 µm. Zygospore: 28-36 x 18-26 µm. Very common in acidic moorland pools, bogs and loch-margins, often in the plankton.</p>

							<h3>Closterium navicula</h3>
							<p>Closterium navicula navicula boasts several captivating physical traits. Its cells are elongated and triangular in cross-section, measuring approximately 20 to 100 micrometers long. The surface is covered with intricate patterns that can vary in texture, making it an aesthetic addition to the microscopic realm. The green hue is primarily due to the presence of chlorophyll, which allows it to perform photosynthesis. One of the distinguishing features of Closterium navicula navicula is its unique cell structure. With two symmetrical halves (semi-cell structures), it resembles a two-lobed boat. Each lobe has appendages known as stigma—these are light-sensitive organelles that aid in movement towards light sources, enhancing their ability to photosynthesize. The complex ornamentation on the surface and the distinctive cell wall morphology can also serve as identification markers. The ecological role of Closterium navicula navicula cannot be overstated. This algae is a vital component of the aquatic ecosystem, serving as a primary producer. Through photosynthesis, it converts sunlight into energy, releasing oxygen as a by-product. This oxygenation is critical for the survival of various aquatic life forms, including fish and other microorganisms. Moreover, as a food source, it supports a diverse array of herbivores and, subsequently, predators within the food chain. </p>
