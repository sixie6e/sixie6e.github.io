							<h3>Nostoc commune</h3>
							<p>Nostoc commune is a colonial species of cyanobacterium. It initially forms a small, hollow gelatinous globule which grows and becomes leathery, flattened and convoluted, forming a gelatinous mass with other colonies growing nearby. Inside the thin sheath are numerous unbranched hair-like structures called trichomes formed of short cells in a string. The cells are bacteria and thus have no nucleus nor internal membrane system. To multiply, they form two new cells when they divide by binary fission. Along the trichomes, larger specialist nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts occur between the ordinary cells. When wet, Nostoc commune is bluish-green, olive green or brown but in dry conditions it becomes an inconspicuous, crisp brownish mat.</p>

							<p>Arthrospira is a genus of free-floating filamentous cyanobacteria characterized by cylindrical, multicellular trichomes in an open left-hand helix. A dietary supplement is made from A. platensis and A. maxima, known as spirulina. The A. maxima and A. platensis species were once classified in the genus Spirulina. Although the introduction of the two separate genera Arthrospira and Spirulina is now generally accepted, there has been much dispute in the past and the resulting taxonomical confusion is tremendous.</p>

							<h3>Chamaesiphon sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Cylindrical cells occur singly or in groups, attached by their base to substrata.  Cells of this genus produce one or more spherical exospores(or exocytes) - asexual reproductive cells that are cut off from the apical end of the parental cell, and bud off through the open, slightly widened top end of the parental cell's sheath.  Division mechanism producing exospores has been described as ‘budding’ (unique in cyanobacteria, Waterbury and Stanier 1977), or as identical to typical cell division of cyanobacteria (Gromov and Mamkaeva  1980). Most species are found attached to substrata in the running waters of cold streams. Others are commonly found on surfaces of aquatic vegetation in lakes. </p>

							<h3>Anabaena sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Anabaena is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria that exist as plankton. They are known for nitrogen-fixing abilities, and they form symbiotic relationships with certain plants, such as the mosquito fern. They are one of four genera of cyanobacteria that produce neurotoxins, which are harmful to local wildlife, as well as farm animals and pets. Production of these neurotoxins is assumed to be an input into its symbiotic relationships, protecting the plant from grazing pressure. A DNA sequencing project was undertaken in 1999, which mapped the complete genome of Anabaena, which is 7.2 million base pairs long. The study focused on heterocysts, which convert nitrogen into ammonia. Certain species of Anabaena have been used on rice paddy fields, proving to be an effective natural fertilizer. </p>

							<h3>Cyanobacteria sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Cyanobacteria (/saɪˌænoʊbækˈtɪəri.ə/), also called Cyanobacteriota or Cyanophyta, are a phylum of autotrophic gram-negative bacteria that can obtain biological energy via oxygenic photosynthesis. The name "cyanobacteria" (from Ancient Greek κύανος (kúanos) 'blue') refers to their bluish green (cyan) color, which forms the basis of cyanobacteria's informal common name, blue-green algae,  although as prokaryotes they are not scientifically classified as algae. Cyanobacteria are probably the most numerous taxon to have ever existed on Earth and the first organisms known to have produced oxygen, having appeared in the middle Archean eon and apparently originated in a freshwater or terrestrial environment. Their photopigments can absorb the red- and blue-spectrum frequencies of sunlight (thus reflecting a greenish color) to split water molecules into hydrogen ions and oxygen. The hydrogen ions are used to react with carbon dioxide to produce complex organic compounds such as carbohydrates (a process known as carbon fixation), and the oxygen is released as a byproduct. By continuously producing and releasing oxygen over billions of years, cyanobacteria are thought to have converted the early Earth's anoxic, weakly reducing prebiotic atmosphere, into an oxidizing one with free gaseous oxygen (which previously would have been immediately removed by various surface reductants), resulting in the Great Oxidation Event and the "rusting of the Earth" during the early Proterozoic,  dramatically changing the composition of life forms on Earth. The subsequent adaptation of early single-celled organisms to survive in oxygenous environments likely had led to endosymbiosis between anaerobes and aerobes, and hence the evolution of eukaryotes during the Paleoproterozoic. Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments such as various forms of chlorophyll, carotenoids, phycobilins to convert the photonic energy in sunlight to chemical energy. Unlike heterotrophic prokaryotes, cyanobacteria have internal membranes. These are flattened sacs called thylakoids where photosynthesis is performed. Photoautotrophic eukaryotes such as red algae, green algae and plants perform photosynthesis in chlorophyllic organelles that are thought to have their ancestry in cyanobacteria, acquired long ago via endosymbiosis. These endosymbiont cyanobacteria in eukaryotes then evolved and differentiated into specialized organelles such as chloroplasts, chromoplasts, etioplasts, and leucoplasts, collectively known as plastids. Sericytochromatia, the proposed name of the paraphyletic and most basal group, is the ancestor of both the non-photosynthetic group Melainabacteria and the photosynthetic cyanobacteria, also called Oxyphotobacteria. The cyanobacteria Synechocystis and Cyanothece are important model organisms with potential applications in biotechnology for bioethanol production, food colorings, as a source of human and animal food, dietary supplements and raw materials. Cyanobacteria produce a range of toxins known as cyanotoxins that can cause harmful health effects in humans and animals. </p>

							<h3>Chroococcus sp unknown</h3>
							<p>Cells or groups of cells (mainly two to four cells), are surrounded by mucilaginous envelopes, and usually occur in microscopic, spherical or composed colonies; rarely form agglomerations. Mucilaginous envelopes are colorless or yellowish, usually copying the cell form, sometimes lamellated, distinct or diffuse at the margin (subg. Chroococcus) or fine, homogeneous, and diffuse, in which the cells or cell groups are irregularly arranged (subg. Limnococcus). Cells at first are spherical or oval, and later are hemispherical or in the form of a segment of the sphere. The cells are 0.7–50 μm in diameter. The cell content is grey, blue-green, olive green, orange, or reddish violet and granular. Only in few planktonic species are there gas vesicles. Cell division is by binary fission in three or more planes, or irregular (in old colonies). Reproduction is by fragmentation of colonies.</p>
